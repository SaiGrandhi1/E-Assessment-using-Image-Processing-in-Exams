# E-Assessment-using-image-processing-in-Exams
This project “E-Assessment using Image Processing in Exams” provides us a simple
interface which supports (primarily in higher education) paper-based examination and makes
it easier, more comfortable and speeds up the whole process while keeping every single
positive attribute of it but also reducing the number of negative aspects. The approach
significantly differs from the ones used in the previous 10+ years which were implemented in
such a way that they could not reproduce and replace the traditional paper-based examination
model. The heart of the article relies on the most important element of the software which is
the image processing flow. All these problems are solved using this project. Throughout the
project, the focus has been on presenting information in an easy and intelligible manner.
